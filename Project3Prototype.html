		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
		<h3>Mechanics</h3>
		<p>
			The player holds a flash-light and searches around the room using mouse movement controls. The player cant move but can
			look all around. The player can hear rustling around the room and will move the flash-light to investigate.
			The player has the opportunity to use the left mouse button to shoot at the creature. If the player misses, the weapon
			has a very long reload time so the player has to try to avoid looking at the creature after it has been startled. After 
			reloading, the player has a chance to shoot the creature.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Controls</h3>
		<p><strong>Mouse Movement</strong> - The player uses the mouse to both point
			the flashlight and shoot the weapons.</p>
		
		<h3>Player Learning</h3>
		<p>
			The first thing the player needs to learn is to move the mouse. Because this
			is relatively intuitive, I doubt we need to teach the player this. Next the player
			learns that pointing the mouse at a specific point will illuminate the surrounding 
			area. Because the game will show a gun as well as a flash-light on the screen, the 
			player can assume that they have to shoot something. Once they explore the room by
			shining the flash-light in different areas, they will come across the threatening 
			looking creature. The first instinct would be to shoot it so the player will fire
			the weapon and either experience the end screen or rush into a panic (depending on 
			their aim). If they miss, the creature will rush the player. The player will probably
			die, and will be prompted with an end game screen and text saying, "The creature doesn't
			like it when the light is shined on it." From here on, the player knows not to shine the
			light on the creature for too long. The last thing the player will learn is that if they 
			miss shooting the creature, the gun will reload very slowly. Here the player knows
			they have another chance to shoot the creature but that they'll have to wait in the dark
			worrying about looking at the creature for too long as it moves around the room.
