Casual Game Development Project 3

This is a demo using three.js libraries with simple game mechanics.

The aim of the project was to create a spooky atmosphere, where the player explores an environment using only a flashlight.
The demo is also an experiment with sound design to help achieve the desired atmospheric effect.
